# utils

Implementation of POSIX compliant utilities and unobtrusive extensions that I see fit.

Manual pages are planned.

PRs are welcome, even if implementing an entire new utility.

## known complete

- `cat`
- `rmdir`
- `sleep`

## complete non-posix utilities

- `fmt`
- `yes`

## incomplete

- any utility not in main branch

## high priority

- [ ] `rm`
- [ ] `mv`
- [ ] `chmod`
- [ ] `mkdir`
- [ ] `sed`
- [ ] the rest
